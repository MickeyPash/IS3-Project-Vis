IS3 Project
===========


You need to use eclipse for this project unfortunately. It's a requirement from the specification.

Here are the steps:


* Clone the repository
* Open eclipse
* Right click the package explorer and select Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace
* Select the option for Select root directory and select the folder "prefuse"


When making a new java file, add it to the is3 package in /src.
